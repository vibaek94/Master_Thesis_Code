# Master_Thesis_Code
This repository contains the code used for my master thesis, in which i contructed and evaluated two RNN model architectures for energy expenditure prediction in children based on accelerometry data.
Dataprep.py contains most of the functions used for data transformation and preproccessing into time series as well as the functions used for plotting my results.
The folder also contains the datasets used for my project and the code used for RNN model training and evauation.
